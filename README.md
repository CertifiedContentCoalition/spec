_Draft of Baseline Specifications_

## Abstract
This specification defines the proposed minimum threshhold that would be required for certification from a Journalistic Certfication Authority under a common framework established by the board of the Certified Content Coalition™. It also defines the two elements of that threshhold, and the basic process for achieving certification. Finally it describes the result of certification and the basic systems of transmital of certification. 

## Introduction
While journalistic standards have existed for decades, traditionally they have been the purview of individual organizations. Free Speech laws and underlying free-expression ideals have in the past prevented the establishment of widely accepted uniform standards that are common in nearly every other industry. Unfortunately in recent years, the pervasiveness of bad actors trying to take advantage of the credibility of legitimate news publishers necessitates a solution designed to assist social media platforms, advertisers, browsing software publishers and ultimately the public to gain increased confidence in the news ecosystem. This draft specification envisions a system of identity verification and auditable editorial control processes that will ensure a balance between maintaining free expression for all with a system to disincentivize entities creating maliciously generated content.
